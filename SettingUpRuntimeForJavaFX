Youtube video from xemacscode
  they downloded Eclipse but I believe this can also be done with IntelliJ
  At the start, go to help and scroll to install new software
  you would have to add a repository and I believe there is one for IntelliJ
  For IntelliJ you would need to download the JavaFX SDK that jetbrains has available
  so for IntelliJ you would start a new project and select JavaFX from the list
  then you would need to add the JDK that you want to use
  also JDK 11 and up need the download of JavaFX beacause it was not added to them
